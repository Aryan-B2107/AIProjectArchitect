#CodeGen Architect


Project Idea: Natural Language Use Case Identification & Template Creation
CodeGen Architect is a project focused on simplifying the initial stages of application development. It aims to empower users to describe their desired application use case in natural language (e.g., "develop a social media application with user profiles and a feed"), after which an AI will generate foundational code, recommend suitable technologies, and provide ready-to-use templates for various components, including frontend, backend, database, and styling.

The core objective is to significantly reduce the time and effort typically spent on project setup, allowing developers to focus more rapidly on core feature development.

 Key Capabilities (Planned)
Natural Language Input: Interprets user-provided descriptions of application use cases.

Intelligent Tech Stack Recommendation: Proposes appropriate technologies (e.g., React, Node.js, Python/Django, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS) based on the identified use case.

Multi-Component Template Generation: Creates foundational code templates for:

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript frameworks/libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).

Backend: Server-side logic (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Flask/Django).

Database: Basic schema definitions and ORM/ODM configurations.

Storage: Placeholder configurations for file storage.

Project Structure Scaffolding: Organizes generated files into a logical and development-ready project directory.

Interactive Clarification (Future): Incorporates functionality to request further details for ambiguous user inputs.

 Operational Overview (High-Level Concept)
User Input: A user provides a natural language description of their intended application (e.g., "create a simple e-commerce website with product listings and a shopping cart").

LLM Interpretation: A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the description to identify key entities, relationships, and functional requirements.

Tech Stack Mapping: Based on the interpreted use case, the LLM determines a suitable technology stack (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend, MongoDB for the database).

Template Generation: The system then generates modular code snippets and file structures for each identified component within the chosen tech stack.

Output: The user receives a downloadable archive containing the scaffolded project, prepared for immediate development.

 Proposed Tech Stack
Core Logic: Python (for orchestration and LLM interaction)

AI/LLM: Google Gemini API (or similar generative AI models)

Frontend Templates: React.js, HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

Backend Templates: Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/Django)

Database Templates: PostgreSQL (SQL), MongoDB (NoSQL)

File System Operations: Python's os and shutil modules

üèÅ Getting Started (Development Setup)
To set up this project for development:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeGen-Architect.git
cd CodeGen-Architect

Install dependencies:

# For Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# For Node.js (if applicable for frontend templates)
npm install

Set up API Keys:

Create a .env file in the root directory.

Add your Google Gemini API key: GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

Run the application:

# Execution instructions will vary based on the initial architecture (e.g., Flask app, CLI tool)
python main.py # (Example)
